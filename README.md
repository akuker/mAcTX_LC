Adapter to use an ATX power supply with a Macintosh LC series computer

# Background
These files were originally developed by blusnowkitty on the 68kMLA forum. They are being archived here so that the community can make updates/changes/improvements as needed and to provide a location for documentation and assembly instructions.

Once again, here's the mAcTX LC KiCad project. Public domain, do whatever, yadda yadda; I just ask 
that you don't use the mAcTX name if you use this in your own project and don't sell for profit. 
This only covers the LC version as the mAcTX IIc is owned by compgeke and it's his choice if he
wants to open-source, public domain, or keep the files private.
